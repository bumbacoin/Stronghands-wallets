v0122 wallets were compiled from original github (as above), OSX required minor alterations to build, windows has no modifications to the source.
v0122 is susceptible to a bug where it is possible to exceed the Max Money variable and break your wallet.

stronghands-IncreaseMaxMoney.zip file includes a specially compiled wallet to help fix broken wallets and a simple read me on how to use it. the borken wallet may be opened using this Qt, any privkeys may be dumped and then imported into a new empty wallet.
